# When Does Speculative History “Begin?”
 
Does the “history” of the speculative philosophy of history begin in the 16th or 17th century or does it date back much further?[^1]. In this Lemon and scholars vacillate without taking a clear stand.  While stating that in one “context [he] would regard it as irrefutable” that its beginnings “would no doubt [be] the 16th or 17th century,”[^2] Lemon calls for a “more generous timespan…within which we can explore incidences of a more loosely defined ‘speculative philosophy of history’.”[^3]. His reasoning seems to be driven by his need to include the “[r]elevent ideas of the Renaissance…Machiavelli, in particular” and those of “earlier notions.”[^4] In taking such a ‘gelatinous’ approach he yanks the reader into a clouded understanding of the issue.
 
He goes on to “poeticize” the passage of time before the delineation of modern, discrete measures.[^5]  While the measure of time was broad (e.g. day/night, weeks, lunar cycles, seasons), they are no less discrete than modern measures.  His observation time is then applied to the very nature of history and the recording of it during this period of ‘temporal indiscretion.’
 
Lemon’s discussion of progress is based on ‘presentism,’ a comparison of historical advancement against the present day.  “[The Ancients] had no notion of ‘historical progress’ and no belief in it”[^6] is a flawed assessment of the pre-classical period, failing to recognize the changes and advancements in wide-ranging areas (e.g. literacy, science, military).[^7] While from a modern perspective the advancements were incremental, contemporaneously they would have appeared to be as staggeringly significant as those made in the space program between 1959 and 1969.  Nowhere does he counter his own argument more clearly than in his observations of the study and understanding of the stars and planets by the pre-classical ancients.[^8] Lemon goes on the cite the opposing arguments of J.B. Bury[^9] and S.L. Jaki [^10] to highlight the discord in the historical academy surrounding the ancients cognizance of their own ‘historical progress.’
 
The shift in perspective that Lemon espouse with the entry into the classical period is equally dissonant.  Through the application of a false ‘bright line,’ he credits the Greeks, particularly the works of Hesiod, with the demystification of their gods and the “comparative freedom of thought [they] enjoyed” as one “factor in the shift from ‘myth’ to ‘philosophy’.”[^11] Nisbet seems to confuse the argument by inferring that the deconstruction of god(s) and the “idea of progress ‘is bound to remain moribund’”, a position richly steeped with a sense of religious coloring.[^12]
 
This demarcation between myth and philosophy wasn’t clear then nor is it now.  Just as historians and philosophers of the ancient past melded historical descriptions with philosophical assessments and interludes, so do modern historians and philosophers.  The line separating the disciplines is, at best, slightly blurred if not completely indistinct.[^13]. Though it is a lengthy and, at times, tedious routing through the history of the speculative history of philosophy, Lemon navigates back to where he started: there is a lack of clarity as to where in history it began.  Ultimately, he leaves it to the students and academics of history to continue ‘fleshing it out.’
