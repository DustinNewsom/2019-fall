# Hello, I'm using Markdown
I have several different things I’d like to discuss about this reading, so I apologize in advance for the disjointed nature of this post. This is just such a vast swath of historical thought, both in time period and perspective. 

### Transitions in thought
The overall transition from mythopoeic perspectives to a pseudo-philosophical norm comes, according to the reading, without a concrete reason. However, this transition interested me greatly due to its different settings. Is it fair or valid to compare the philosophical perspectives of two different regions as if they tell *one* story? This question interested me especially due to the fact that Egyptian culture as described in this book **still existed** during the time of Greco-Roman ‘progress’. Where can we, as modern historians, find the progress of Egyptian schools of thought during the same period, or is it even possible? Lastly, does this perspective subscribe totally to the ‘linear’ approach to history?

### The archetypal past
Another smaller observation is on the concept of the ‘golden’ or ‘pristine’ age. Out of every school of thought described in these chapters, this one seems most applicable to our continuing approaches to the world. Take the idealized view of the 1950s so many Americans have today, or the Pre-Raphealite romanticism towards the medieval world. 

### Cyclical time
Finally, the concept of cyclical time leads to more questions. These cycles, explained somewhat by Aristotle’s concept of biological growth and decay, are approached by Lemon as a past step towards a more modern ‘linear’ concept of time. Anecdotally, however, many of the history classes and personal observations I have made about them tend to lean towards a viewpoint of **both** progress and cyclical movement. I wonder, is *this* the next step in philosophical views on history? For example, the political cycles of Greco-Roman thinking, rooted in decay, are mimicked by the likes of Marx, played out in the history of Great Britain, and so on.

### Putting it together (kind of)
The main source of questioning for almost any of these subjects may be the monolith treatment Lemon gives them. Attempting to create a whole viewpoint of ancient peoples across the world, in different cultures and living different experiences, seems an impossible task. So does creating one consistent viewpoint between all Greco-Roman philosophers, which Lemon himself addresses the danger of. In his words, we should:
>“rest content with that mixed, even contradictory bag… as a more likely account of classical speculations on history” (44).

To place too much blame on Lemon here is also short-sighted of me, and I acknowledge that his task of summarizing all of the philosophy of history, ever, is an extremely lofty goal to achieve in 428 pages. Perhaps Lemon is **intentionally** encouraging critical thought to his own summary.
