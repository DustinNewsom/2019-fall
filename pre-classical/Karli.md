# The Wrong View of Human Progress

Throughout reading *Pre-classical Ideas on 'History'* Lemon talks about the idea of "a *Mythical* view of space and time"(15) and that people in ancient times did this because they didn’t have the understanding of why events occurred. Lemon also talks about the concept of Human progress and the fact that ancient peoples didn't understand this idea.  Especially when it came to science and technology, but I don’t necessarily agree with Lemon and his statements of calling ancient people ignorant as you can read on page 23 of *History of Philosophy*. When it comes to calling ancient people ignorant in these two subjects, he also talks about the fact that they had no concept of progress, but then he contradicts himself by saying that they did have an understanding in astronomy. Lemons statement is arguable.
 
 Ancient peoples had an understanding of human progress, but they only progressed as far as they needed with materials that was available at the time. They didn’t develop more technology because they based their developments on survival. When I think of science in ancient times I think about architecture, and how these people made buildings to with stand earthquakes, floods and hold up in colder and hotter temperatures. It took a basic understanding of science and math They may not have an understanding of what we think of as science, but they had a basic understanding of how things work. When I think of Human progress now, I think of the Greeks. 

Religion and their *mythical view* didn’t impede human progress or inability to develop science, but instead helped it. Lemon said himself that “…ancient cultures looked to the afterlife, the defeat of death, or release from eternal wheel of fate, as the only real value to be cherished” (24). It’s true that ancient people put a lot of value on the afterlife, but people were constantly trying to make themselves seem better to be more appealing and worthy to the Gods. Lemon should not have called ancient people ignorant for their lack of understanding of what we think of as progress, but instead research a little more on their contributions and their inventions they made that helped them survive. Without some of their research and inventions *human progress* wouldn’t be made till later in time.
